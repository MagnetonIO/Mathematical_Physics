# Unifying Quantum and Classical Mechanics in Functional Programming

This repository contains Haskell and Python implementations of proofs from the paper "A Unified Mathematical Framework for Physics: Integrating Quantum and Classical Mechanics." The code demonstrates key concepts in functional programming style and is organized by function.
